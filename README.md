## Body Map
Body Map is a teaching/learning tool for anatomy topics.

### Description
A teacher or student can create a custom page that includes an interactive 3D model of a specific body system, buttons that point to a specific organ with a custom label, and an article.  The article will auto-detect vocabulary that correlates with an organ in the model and create a button that points to it as well.

### Planning
You can see how the models are set up on this ![database diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/c60f77b0-9894-487a-bc2b-bcefdf8d5063)
